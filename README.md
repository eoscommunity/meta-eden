# Welcome to Lēden 🌳
Lēden (formerly Meta Eden) is a place where you're free to share well-constructed ideas, aptly called 'seeds', related to [Eden](https://genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org/) and EOS, [Fractally](https://fractally.com/), EOSIO and [Mandel](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel).  

We invite you to freely share your thoughts as well as lead others to discover, collaborate and expand upon your ideas via opening issues and pull requests. Seeds you plant here should contain all information for the idea to grow into reality.  

*This isn't the place for core code edits, nor is it the place for explanatory material, nor discourse outside of opening issues.*  

> Read the original [Meta Eden Proposal](https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/smart-start-proposal-by-douglas-butner-of-cxc-world-eden-mock-election-2/4024?u=dougbutner)

## How it Works

You'll find **specific topics** where Eden and EOS show an opportunity to improve **in folders** in this repository under the EOS + Eden directories. 

Browse .md files in these folders to read other's suggestions related to that topic. 

If you'd like to improve another seed you see, **first open an issue on the topic** via the issues tab. 

If you've already done this, and are ready to move on to **formalize** the changes, open a **Pull Request (PR)**. Elders will review this pull request. 

If you have suggestions to improve this repo, *please open an issue.*

# Contributor Rewards 👨‍💻

To encourage participation, this repo's creator has secured funding for contributors via an Eden proposal. To collect the reward, your seed (original idea) must be accepted via pull request, and you then must contact Douglas on [telegram](https://t.me/godsolislove), [twitter](https://twitter.com/dougbutner) or [email](mailto:dougbutner@gmail.com) to collect the reward. There is no limit to how many seeds you can submit. 

## Funding Received 💰
10 EOS from Eden Mock Election #2
10 EOS from godsolislove 

Currently Available: 20 EOS

# New Incentive Model 💸
We're now focusing on rewarding collaboration 

1. New proposals: Actionable and well-described proposals. **10 EOS**

2. Contributing via an Issue or Pull request: Changes that make it into the final proposal will be rewarded **1 EOS** (Max 5 per proposal)

3. Having your Repo contributed to will get you **1 EOS** (Max 5 EOS)

> Each proposal will get 10-20 EOS total for contributors.

# Submit on Hive 🐝

*Not techy?* Submit your seed on Hive blockchain using the same [seed template](Seed%20Template.md). Both use Markdown. We will share your work here, and give you credit in the contributor list. Rewarded contributions (not including initial post 10 EOS) must then be done on Github, though you are welcome to comment ideas on the Hive post as well. I use [Peakd.com](https://peakd.com) to compose + save my drafts and templates for Hive posts.
